# Baseball Analytics Projects
### By Patrick Mellady

This repository contains multiple baseball analytics research questions and solutions implemented in R.

* Question 1 has two parts: predicting if a pitch will be called a strike given the batter didn't swing ad projecting 2025 strikeout rates
* Question 2 is concerned with projecting the pitch mix that a batter will see in the coming season
* Question 3 is concerned with projecting the professional placement of college players in summer leagues

Each question has a pdf report that gives a breakdown of what kind of model has been fit to the data which includes with graphical output of the results and a corresponding R code that gives how the model was implemented. The data for questions 1 and 2 are private and cannot be shared. The data for question 3 were scraped from Baseball-Reference.com using the rvest package. If you would like a copy of the data for question 3, feel free to email me.

I am interested in improving these models and exploring more baseball related data analysis projects and pursuing baseball data analytics professionally. If you have any interesting project ideas, thoughts on how to improve the projects in this repository, want the data for question 3, are an analytics professional working with a baseball team, or have any other general questions, I can be reached at patrickmellady@gmail.com.
