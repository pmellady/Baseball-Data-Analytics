# Machine-Learning-Implementations
### By Patrick Mellady

This repository contains multiple machine learning based methods implemented from scratch. 

*  The files DENN.R and PDENN.R contain neural network solvers for differential equations and partial differential equations, respectively. To see the derivation, implmentation, and results of these methods, see the NN pdf for a full exposition.
*  The files kernel_based_methods.R and mvkde.R contain kernel estimators for density estimation and non-parametric regression. To see the derivation, implementation, and results from these methods, see the KDE pdf for a full exposition.
